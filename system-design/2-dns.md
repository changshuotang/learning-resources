## DNS (Domain Name System)

A DNS translates a domain name/url to an IP address. Your router or ISP provides information on which DNS server(s) to contact. Lower level DNS servers cache the mappings, which can become stale due to DNS propagation delays. DNS response can be cached by your browser or OS for a certain period of time, determined by the time to live (TTL).

- __'NS' record__ (Name Server): specifies the DNS servers for your domain
- __'MX' record__ (Mail Exchange): specifies the mail servers for accepting messages
- __'A' record__ (Address): maps a domain name to an IP address
- __'CNAME' record__ (Canonical Name): specifies a domain name is an alias for another domain
