## Application Layer

Separating the web layer from the application/platform layer allows you to scale and configure both layers independently. So a new API might only result in adding more application servers without needing to add more web webservers.

### Microservices

A suite of small, independently deployable, modular services. Each service runs a unique process and is typically exposed through an API.

Pinterest for example could have microservices for: user profiles, followers, feedm search, photo upload, etc.

### Service Discovery

Find services in a network by mapping and keeping track of names, addresses, and ports in a service registry.
